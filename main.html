I was encouraged to enroll by a fromer student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curcciculum and staff did not disapointed. They agile team project, in particular was outstanding, it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have .

It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend"
